# Edge Server Placement Project



This project aims to determine the optimized positions for edge servers using two approaches: Top K and Genetic Algorithms. The dataset used for this project is provided by Shanghai Telecom and includes extensive records of internet access through various base stations in Shanghai, China.

Due to limitations of my device, the code uses only data in the first half of 06/2024 instead of the whole dataset.

Details are in the notebooks.
